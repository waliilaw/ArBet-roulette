# Roulette Game AO Integration - Summary of Changes

We've implemented full AO process integration for your roulette game. Here's what was done:

1. Replaced the mock AO randomness implementation with real AO process integration
2. Updated the roulette-game-ao-process.lua with proper handlers for randomness generation
3. Added error handling with local randomness fallbacks for robustness
4. Added detailed logging to help with debugging and verification
5. Created documentation to guide deployment and testing

The implementation now meets the Arweave Hacker House selection criteria by properly using an AO process for randomness generation in your roulette game.
